# Cartpole
Some attempts at the cartpole problem

Following the methods outlined in Barto and Sutton, I have attempted to solve the Cartpole problem. There is a tabular solution, a tile encoding solution and a neural network agent.

So far, I have only implemented the Sarsa algorithm. Off-policy Q-learning, episode replay, or n-step Sarsa are possibilities to try next.
